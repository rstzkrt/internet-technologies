        The river slowly meandered through the open space.
        It had hidden secrets that it didn't want to reveal.
            It had a <mark>well-planned</mark> strategy to appear calm, inviting, and appealing.
        That's how the river lured her unknowing victims to her water's edge.

            One dollar and eighty-seven cents.<strong> That was all.</strong> And sixty cents of it was in pennies.
            Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and
            the butcher until oneâ€™s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such
            close dealing implied. One dollar and eighty-seven cents.

            It's an unfortunate reality that we don't teach people how to make money
            (beyond getting a 9 to 5 job) as part of our education system.
            The truth is there are a lot of different, legitimate ways to make money.
            That doesn't mean they are easy and that you won't have to work hard to succeed,
            but <mark style="background-color: dodgerblue">it does mean that if you're willing to open your mind a bit you
            don't have to be stuck in an office from 9 to 5 for the next fifty years</mark> of your life.
